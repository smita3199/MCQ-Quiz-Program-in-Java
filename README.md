# MCQ-Quiz-Program-in-Java

MCQ Quiz Program is implemented using Java AWT and Java Swing GUI. The program allows the user to answer up to 10 Java programming basic questions. Then it displays a report that shows all the questions, their correct answers, the answers selected by the user and the total number of correct answers. The program uses two two-dimensional arrays, one for storing pairs of questions and their possible answers and another one for storing pairs of questions and their correct answers. The answer selected by the user is added to the HashMap object for the report.
